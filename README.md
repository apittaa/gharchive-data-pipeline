## Introduction
This project is a data engineering project that aims to build a data pipeline to process the data from the [GitHub Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/) project. The data pipeline will extract the data from the GitHub Archive, transform the data into a structured format, and load the data into a data warehouse. The data warehouse will be used to perform data analysis on the data.

## Data Source
The data source for this project is the [GitHub Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/) project. The GitHub Archive project is a project that collects and stores the public GitHub timeline data for analysis. The data is stored in JSON format and is available for download from the GitHub Archive website.

## Data Pipeline
The data pipeline for this project consists of the following steps:
1. Extract the data from the GitHub Archive.
2. Transform the data into a structured format.
3. Load the data into a data warehouse.

## Data Model
The data model for this project consists of the following tables:
1. `events` - Contains information about the events in the GitHub Archive.
2. `actors` - Contains information about the actors in the GitHub Archive.
3. `repos` - Contains information about the repositories in the GitHub Archive.

## ETL Process
The ETL process for this project consists of the following steps:
1. Extract the data from the GitHub Archive.
2. Transform the data into a structured format.
3. Load the data into a data warehouse.

## Data Quality Checks
The data quality checks for this project consist of the following checks:
1. Check that the data has been loaded into the data warehouse.
2. Check that the data is in the correct format.

## Data Analysis
The data analysis for this project consists of the following analysis:
1. Count the number of events in the GitHub Archive.
2. Count the number of actors in the GitHub Archive.
3. Count the number of repositories in the GitHub Archive.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has successfully built a data pipeline to process the data from the GitHub Archive. The data pipeline has extracted the data from the GitHub Archive, transformed the data into a structured format, and loaded the data into a data warehouse. The data warehouse has been used to perform data analysis on the data.
